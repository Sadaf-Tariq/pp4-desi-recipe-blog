# About everything DESI
everythingDESI is a recipe blog web application, for people who love desi food. This website provides a platform for desi food lovers to share 
their favorite food recipes, share their opinions, like, and give ratings to help others to try the best ones available.

The website is interactive and responsive and also allows users to register themselves.

# Data
## Database Diagram
The Database diagram shows the relationship between the tables created by the model. The user custom table that was created by the custom model is shown 
in the diagram as this was directly connected with the model.

The 'Recipe' model is the main model which contains most of the details. The main purpose of the application is to display the recipe details and add new recipes,
which is done by the recipe model. To filter the recipes by 'category' and 'method' I created two separate models 'RecipeCategory' and 'RecipeMethod'. This one-to-many relationship enables to create recipes with different methods and categories. 

The application also allows the user to comment and rate the recipes. The 'Comment' and 'Rating' models allow the user to fulfill this task. The one-to-many relationship between these models allows the user to comment and rate multiple recipes. 

I used [DrawSQL](https://drawsql.app/) to draw and visualize the database schema.

 ## User Custom Model

 The user model is customized to take 'email' and 'password' rather than the built-in 'username' field. The email field is set to 'Unique' and the username is 
 set to none. This data is used with the recipe and comment model as one-to-many relationships.

* Another error I found for the menu.html page, where I put an anchor element inside a button element, I solved that error by replacing the button to form 
* For the style.css for the header element in a media query, I got an error because there was a margin selector that had a negative value, I solved that error by removing that selector

# Unfixed Bugs
There is no unfixed bugs but there is a warning indicated by html validator for gallery.html page of the website, for my design I do not need any header for this section of the page that is why this warning was not entertained
